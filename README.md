Healthcare and Labour Impacts of Post COVID-19 Condition in Canada: A Health Economic Costing Model

### Abstract
<b>Background</b>: The COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a range of long-term health challenges, notably post-COVID-19 condition (PCC), characterized by persistent symptoms beyond 12 weeks after initial infection. With an estimated 1.4 million Canadians affected, PCC poses a significant economic burden in Canada. We aimed to estimate the economic burden associated with the healthcare and labour impacts of the post-COVID-19 condition (PCC). 

<b>Methods</b>: This study utilized the Canadian COVID-19 Antibody and Health Survey Cycle 2 (CCAHS-2) data alongside published literature to analyze healthcare utilization and productivity losses due to PCC. Our cohort included Canadian adults reporting persistent symptoms 84 days post-SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 2020 and May 2022. Healthcare and productivity-related costs were modelled from a single-payer system perspective using Monte Carlo simulations to accommodate parameter uncertainties.

<b>Results</b>: We analyzed data from 1,318,912 participants from CCAHS-2, identifying significant healthcare and productivity costs attributed to PCC over 29 months. The study estimated that individuals reporting PCC symptoms had approximately CAD 11.23 billion in healthcare costs and CAD 10.22 billion in lost productivity. Subgroup analyses indicated that unvaccinated individuals and females experienced higher economic impacts compared to vaccinated individuals and males, respectively. 

<b>Conclusion</b>: The economic burden of PCC, including both healthcare costs and productivity losses, was estimated at CAD $21.46 billion, indicating a substantial fiscal impact on the Canadian economy. Our results also highlight the importance of vaccination and the need for adequate infection control measures to reduce future economic costs.
