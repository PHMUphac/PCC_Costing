Healthcare and Labour Impacts of Post-COVID-19 Condition in Canada: A Health Economic Costing Model

### Abstract
<b>Background</b>: Millions of adult Canadians are affected by post-COVID-19 condition (PCC, or Long COVID), characterized by symptoms persisting 12 weeks or more after SARS-CoV-2 infection. 

<b>Methods</b>: We used the Canadian COVID-19 Antibody and Health Survey Cycle 2 (CCAHS-2) data alongside published literature to estimate economic burdens for individuals reporting PCC symptoms using Monte Carlo simulations. Our cohort included Canadian adults reporting persistent symptoms â‰¥84 days post-SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 2020 and May 2022. We adopted a health system perspective to estimate costs related to all-cause inpatient hospitalizations, emergency department visits, general practitioner visits, and specialist visits. We also adopted a societal perspective with a focus on labour-related productivity losses. We packaged model results into an R Shiny Application that is available online.

<b>Results</b>: Our cohort included a sample of 962 participants reporting PCC symptoms, weighted to represent 1,318,912 adult Canadians. Those individuals had an estimated CAD 3.86 (95% simulation interval [SI]: 2.40, 5.87) billion in outpatient and hospital healthcare costs and CAD 18.76 (95% SI: 12.78, 25.23) billion in lost labour productivity. Subgroup analyses indicated that females and unvaccinated individuals experienced significantly higher economic impacts per person infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to males and vaccinated individuals, respectively. 

<b>Conclusion</b>: Those reporting PCC symptoms had an estimated CAD 22.62 billion in hospital and outpatient services and productivity losses, indicating a substantial fiscal impact on the Canadian economy.
